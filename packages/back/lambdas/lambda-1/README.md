TODO :

- webpack prod should exclude test.ts files
- find a way to exclude files from tsconfig and not webpack like index.local.ts : just put them in tsconfig as it should be, and remove it from the loader in webpack
- tsfork typescript configFile = tsconfig.build si prod sinon tsconfig
- add eslint in the repo and tsfork plugin and add it only for webpack dev tsfork plugin
- tsfork option typescript build true pour les project reference
